# Vanilla OS Meta Appstream

This repository contains appstream metainfo files and tools for adding new packages to Vanilla OS Meta.

## How it works

Every application part of Vanilla OS Meta needs to have a `.metainfo.xml` file, which is then used by
the builder script to create an Appstream Catalog file (the file shipped by our repository).
A [metainfo](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Metadata.html#sect-Metadata-GenericComponent) file is, at its core, an XML file that describes all aspects of an application and is used by
software stores such as GNOME Software or KDE's Discover to provide information to the user.
Inside a metainfo file, we provide information about a component -- which can be a desktop
application, a library, a font, or a codec -- such as its id, name, description, license, categories, etc.
An Appstream Catalog is a collection of components that can be installed on the system.

### How to add a new application

We provide a template metainfo file inside `utils/` that contains all tags required for adding a
basic application, but a good metainfo file contains much more information than just the
mandatory tags. Some elements you should consider adding are:
- Extra [url's](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Metadata.html#tag-url) for the projects bug tracker, donations page, repository, etc
- Older [releases](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Metadata.html#tag-releases) with detailed changelogs
- MIME types inside [provides](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Metadata.html#tag-provides) if the application handles specific file types
- [Screenshots](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Metadata.html#tag-screenshots) of the application
- Localized tags for name, description, and summary

The metainfo file should be named as `the.application.id.metainfo.xml` and be placed inside
`/packages/usr/share/metainfo`.

### Where to find info about an application

Most of the time, if the application you wish to add already has a version on Flathub, we would
advise against submitting it to Vanilla OS Meta and use the Flathub version instead.
However, some applications like Steam may have some quirks in their Flatpak versions that could
justify a place in the Apx repository.
Most Flathub applications contain a metainfo file in their [Flathub repository](https://github.com/flathub/)
(or a `.appdata.xml`, which was deprecated in favor of metainfo) that you could use as reference
for populating your own file.

If the application doesn't have a version on Flathub, you should try searching the app's repository
for relevant information. You can often find a short description in the README, and sometimes
screenshots are stored inside the repository itself.

### How to build the Catalog

Before sumbitting a new application, you must ensure your contribution contains valid Appstream
elements, as it will not appear in the software stores if it is malformed.
We provide a builder script inside `/utils` that will generate an Appstream Catalog with all
metainfo files and report any issues it finds for each applicaton.
You should make sure the scipt at least doesn't report any errors, but you should also handle any
warnings and suggestions if they apply.

To run the builder script, you need the following packages:
- *appstream*
- *appstream-compose*

**NOTE:** At the time of writing, the most recent `appstreamcli` version in the default (apt)
Apx container is *0.15.2*, which contains a bug that causes metainfo validation to return an error
for all release timestamps.
This bug has been fixed in version *0.15.6*, which is available in the OpenSUSE repositories, so we
strongly recommend running the build script inside Apx Zypper container.

```sh
$ apx --zypper enter
$ sudo zypper install AppStream
$ ./util/appstream_builder.sh
```
